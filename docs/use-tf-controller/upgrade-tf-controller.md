# Upgrading TF-Controller

Please follow these steps to upgrade TF-Controller:

1. Read the latest release changelogs.
2. Check your API versions.
3. To make sure you don't get new state changes, suspend Terraform resources (`tfctl suspend --all`) to minimize the impact on live systems.
4. Back up Terraform tfstates to avoid losing data. If you're using the default backend with secrets in Kubernetes, use your backup toolset (i.e., Velero) to back up the state data.
5. Upgrade Flux first, following [the Flux documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/upgrade/).
6. Disable [auto-approval](https://weaveworks.github.io/tf-controller/use_tf_controller/to_provision_resources_and_auto_approve/) by either removing the approvePlan value or setting it to "".
7. To prevent unintentional resource deletions, set the `spec.destroyResourcesOnDeletion` flag to `false` for critical or production systems (the default value is `false`)
8. If the Flux upgrade goes well, proceed to upgrade the TF-controller via its image tag. Adjust the values in the HelmRelease to match the new version to which you are upgrading.
9. Check the pod logs for the TF-Controller deployment and any runner logs in order to identify potential issues. If you check the `warnings` in the logs, you can also identify any required API changes. For example:
` v1alpha1 Terraform is deprecated, upgrade to v1alpha2`.
10. Push the changes you made.
11. Resume your Terraform resourcesâ€”either one-by-one for critical resources, or all of them with `tfctl resume --all`
12. Ensure no changes are planned for deletion. If you changed the value in step 6 from `spec.destroyResourcesOnDeletion` to `false`, resources will not be automatically removed.
13. Revert back to auto-approval mode after ensuring stability.
14. Resume any suspended Kustomization objects to restore GitOps automation.
15. Restore `spec.destroyResourcesOnDeletion`, if this has been disabled for any resources in critical or production systems.

TF-Controller supports v1alpha1 for backward compatibility. This means that you need v1alpha2 for newer (as of September 2023) features such as:
- the branch planner
- pod sub-domain DNS resolutions
- new PodSpec fields like PriorityClass, SecurityContext, and ResourceRequirements (Limits / Requests)
